<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>My name is Matias, but you can call me Mati. I am 23 years old, starting a new chapter in my life, going into cybersecurity. While I am deciding between ethical hacking, security operation center (SOC) analysis, and governance, risk, & compliance, my goal is to become a SOC analyst with occasional ethical hacking, here and there. As someone who's been chronically online for 12 years, as well as having an analytical mindset, and being a lifelong learner, I've always been curious about new challenges and shifted my mindset to knowing life doesn't always go the way you expect. However, as long as you can put your mind into whatever you are disciplined to do, you can accomplish a lot. When I'm not at my desk, I love watching documentaries, watching older movies & TV shows, listening to music, spending time with my family & friends, going to my local church, and playing my favorite video games.</p>
